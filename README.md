# Project : Predicting House Price 

# Description :
In this project we have applied machine learning concepts on the dataset to predict the selling prices of houses. Exploration and analysis of the data is been done first. Then splitting of data into test and train sets and determine the performance. Then selecting a proper model and algorithm is done. 

We have worked with data set in python and applying basic concepts and understanding of Machine Learning techniques.
