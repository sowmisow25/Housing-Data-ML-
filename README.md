# Predicting House Prices Using Machine Learning 

</div>

## Overview :
This project focuses on predicting house prices by applying Machine Learning techniques to a housing dataset. By analyzing key features of the data, this project aims to build a model that accurately predicts house prices, assisting individuals and businesses in making informed decisions regarding real estate.

The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation, showcasing the end-to-end implementation of machine learning concepts.


## Features :
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Initial analysis to understand the dataset.
- Identification of trends and relationships among features.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Feature scaling and transformation to enhance model performance.

### 3. Model Training:
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Training multiple machine learning models to predict house prices.

### 4. Model Evaluation:
- Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Fine-tuning the best-performing model for optimized predictions.

### 5. Prediction:
- Using the trained model to predict house prices on new data.

## Dataset
